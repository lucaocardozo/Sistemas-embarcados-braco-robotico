## Project Description
In this project it was developed the control of a robotic arm via Wi-Fi, using a microcontroller, through a web interface.
To realise this, the ArduinoIDE interface was used and the following languages were used: C, JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
The biggest challenge encountered was to find a way to reduce abrupt movements and decrease the delay to control the robotic arm via Wi-Fi.


## How to Install and Run the Project
It is necessary to install ArduinoIDE and import the project folder


## What is needed to replicate the project
To make a similar project, you need a NodeMCU ESP8266 V3 microcontroller (Lolin), a NodeMCU base ver1.0, 4 servo motors (9G SG90) and a robotic arm.


## How to control the arm via Wi-Fi
To control the robotic arm via Wi-Fi using the web interface, is to power the robotic arm, connect to the Wi-Fi network generated by the robotic arm. And access the page: 192.168.4.1
